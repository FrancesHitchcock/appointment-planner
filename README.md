## Context
This project is a Codecademy challenge project completed as the culmination of the React I and II modules. A starter code was provided.

## Objectives
The following skills were required: 
* JSX
* React Components
* Components Interacting
* Stateless Components From Stateful Components
* Advanced React
* Hooks

## Specification
The following project goals were specified:
"In this project, you will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. 
The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments."
Each of the contacts and appointment pages renders a form component to collect data, and a tile list component which renders an array of tile components.
In addition, the appointments form renders a contact picker component to select a contact name when creating a new appointment object.

## Response
I successfully completed this project with no help and without referring to the sample solution code. The hints provided with the task descriptions were the only support.
